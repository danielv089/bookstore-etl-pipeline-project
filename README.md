# Python ETL Project: Scraping, Transforming, and Loading Book Data

V1.0 Python and SQLite

## 📌 Summary

This project is a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python. The purpose of this script to scrape book-related data from the web, clean, transform, normalize that data, and store it into a SQL database.

The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate a practical, end-to-end data engineering workflow by widely used tools and technologies.

The project begins by **extracting** the data from HTML format through web scraping from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com), a publicly available site designed for practicing scraping techniques. The scraped data includes attributes such as book title, price, availability, and genre etc..

Once the raw data is collected, the **transformation stage** cleans it by:

- Checking and removing duplicates and null values  
- Trimming whitespace and standardizing formats and data types along the table 
- Extracting and normalizing genres into a separate lookup table  
- Splitting book in stock information into it's own table 
- Generating cleaned datasets stored as CSV files and Pandas DataFrames

Finally, the **load phase** writes the normalized datasets into a local **SQLite database**.

- `books`: primary book data
- `genres`: genre reference table  
- `in_stock`: current stock status
