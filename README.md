# Python ETL Project: Scraping, Transforming, and Loading Book Data

## üìå Summary

This project is a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python. The purpose of this script to scrape book-related data from the web, clean, transform, normalize that data, and store it into a SQL database. The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate a practical, end-to-end data engineering workflow by widely used tools and technologies.

## V1.2 Python and SQLite

1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract
- Scrapes all catalog pages from Books to Scrape
- Retrieves metadata including title, genre, rating, price, stock, UPC, and number of reviews
- Stores raw results as a CSV (1_extract_raw_data/books_raw_data.csv)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Transform
- Removes duplicates and null values
- Standardizes data types and formats
- Reclassifies Default and Add a comment gnere into Uncategorized
- Maps rating strings to numerical values
- Cleans currency symbols and parses stock quantities
- Saves cleaned data to 2_transform_data/books_cleaned_data.csv

3Ô∏è‚É£ Normalize
- Extracts a genre lookup table
- Replaces genre strings with foreign key IDs
- Splits in_stock data into its own table
- Saves normalized CSV files to 3_normalized_data/

4Ô∏è‚É£ Load
- Loads normalized tables into a local SQLite database: 4_database/books.db
- Tables created:
- books: main book data
- genres: genre reference table
- in_stock: stock information
